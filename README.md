# NahuatLEX

Project Description:
NahuatLEX is a comprehensive collection of lexical resources for Nahuatl languages, offering etymological dictionaries that connect various dialects and historical variants. The platform provides interconnected dictionaries showing relationships between Classical Nahuatl, modern dialects, and colonial-era variants, allowing researchers, linguists, and community members to trace word evolution and relationships across the Nahuatl language family.
